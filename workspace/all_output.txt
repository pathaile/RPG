Based on the assumptions made, the following core classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

Classes:
- Player: Represents the player character and contains information such as health, level, and inventory.
- Enemy: Represents an enemy character and contains information such as health and damage.
- Item: Represents an item that can be picked up and added to the player's inventory.
- Weapon: Represents a weapon that can be equipped by the player and used in combat.
- Armor: Represents a piece of armor that can be equipped by the player and provides defense in combat.
- Quest: Represents a quest that the player can undertake and contains information such as objectives and rewards.
- NPC: Represents a non-playable character that the player can interact with and receive quests from.

Functions/Methods:
- move(): Allows the player to move around the game world.
- attack(): Allows the player to attack an enemy in combat.
- defend(): Allows the player to defend against an enemy's attack in combat.
- use_item(): Allows the player to use an item from their inventory.
- equip_weapon(): Allows the player to equip a weapon from their inventory.
- equip_armor(): Allows the player to equip a piece of armor from their inventory.
- complete_quest(): Allows the player to complete a quest and receive rewards.

Next, we will create the necessary files for the RPG game:
